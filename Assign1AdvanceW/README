The code was run successfully.
Detailing usage:
	The process to run the code:
		This project is a .JAVA code, please import it into JAVA execution software (e.g: Eclipse)
		Run the Main.java in RUNING package ( if running other Main.java in usingTCP.package or usingUDP.package, 
			there will appear an error)
		On the Console the user should follow the below steps to get Throughput and TotalTime:
		1. The first line will appear [Please choose Protocol(UDP/TCP):]
			User need to input: UDP (if you want to use UDP Protocol);
				or TCP (if you want to use TCP Protocol)
			Then click "enter" in keyboard
		2. The second line will appear [Please choose Standard(802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11ac1, 802.11ac2, 802.11ax):]
			User need to input:"802.11a (if you want to use Standard 802.11a), 
				or 802.11g, 
				or 802.11ac1, 
				or 802.11ac2, 
				or 802.11ax
			Then click "enter" in keyboard
		3. The third line will appear [Please choose DataRate...]:
			DataRate for each standard, which the user used is shown in the third line, 
				input one of the DataRate
			Then click "enter" in keyboard
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------			
		4. Then the result will output in line 9 to line 12
			Throughput [Mbps] in the normal case: ...
			The total time to transmit 10GB(μs): ...
			Throughput [Mbps] in the best case: ...
			The total time to transmit 10GB(μs): ...
		5. There is some notes for the result calculation: 
			line 4 show the choice of the user
			line 5 to line 8 say there are two type of throughput on 802.11ac1, 802.11ac2, 802.11ax, 802.11n
				802.11a and 802.11g only have value in the normal case
				TotalFrame(10GB): 10737418240				
Explaining:
	Why there is a difference between the actual throughput and the advertised data rate:
		The actual throughput, which is the maximum amount of data can be transmitted from a sender to a receiver.
		The advertised data rate is the actual amount of data that has been transmitted. 
		There are different factors, such as latency, user density or environmental noise, affecting the throughput. 
			User density or environmental noise can and likely will change over time, and will effect the 
			throughput as well.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	802.11 performance improves after each release. Briefly discuss the trade-offs involved in such improvements:
		The performance was improved in five parts: Frequency band, Bandwidth, Modulation, Max physical rate and 
		antennas.
			The range of Bandwidth band and Max physical rate has been increased, and the maximum value of them 
			have been higher
			Method of signal modulation has been changed from DSSS or FSSS to OFDM
			Type of antennas has been changed from SISO(signal in signal out) to MIMO(multiple in and multiple out)
		Trade-offs involved in such improvements:
			The reliability has been improved:
			Each receiving antenna gets a slightly different version of the signal allowing for successful decoding) 
			The throughput has been improved:
			Multiple antennas can be used simultaneously and the Bandwidth has been increased. This means the channel
			could receive-transmit more than one signal at the same time, and thus this increases the throughput.
			The cost on Bits has been decreased (https://cse.buffalo.edu/faculty/dimitrio/publications/infocom15.pdf).
	        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			With the increasing of the reliability and the throughput, the cost on money also increasing:
			There are more money needed to improve the ability of the system, such as construction and configuration.
			And the improvements not always are energy efficiency.
Introduction:
	There are three inputs:
		Protocol (UDP/TCP);
		Standard (802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11n, 802.11ac_w1, 802.11ac_w2,802.11ax);
		Available data rate for each standard.
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	There are four output:
		Throughput [Mbps] in the normal case;
		The total time to transmit 10GB(μs) in the normal case;
		Throughput [Mbps] in the best case;
		The total time to transmit 10GB(μs) in the best case;
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	802.11n, 802.11ac_w1, 802.11ac_w2,802.11ax In best case:	
		40MHz/4SS for .11n: 46 μs (using 4 Spatial Streams)
			NChan: 108
		80MHz/3SS for .11ac_w1: 56.8 μs (using 3 Spatial Streams)
			NChan: 234
		160MHz/8SS for .11ac_w2: 92.8 μs (using 8 Spatial Streams) 
			NChan: 468
		160MHz/8SS for .11ax: 92.8 μs (using 8 Spatial Streams) 
			NChan: 1960
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The structure of the code:
		RUNING.package control TCP.package and UDP.package;
		TCP.package or UDP.package control the calculation on TCP transmission or UDP transmission; 
		In each TCP.package or UDP.package there are six class (Main, Protocol802.11a, Protocol802.11g, 
		Protocol802.11n, Protocol802.11ac_w1, Protocol802.11ac_w2 and Protocol802.11ax)
	The structure of each Protocol802.11... class:
		There are three main method:Throughtput(); Oncetime() and Totaltime(). 
		 * A single data frame exchange equation for UDP:
	 	 *         DIFS+RTS+SIFS+CTS+SIFS+DATA+SIFS+ACK
	 	 * A single data frame exchange equation for TCP:
	 	 * 		   DIFS+RTS+SIFS+CTS+SIFS+TCPDATA+SIFSt+ACK+DIFS++RTS+SIFS+CTS+SIFS+TCPACK+SIFS+ACK; 
	 	 * A single data frame exchange equation for 802.11g need to add Extension.
		 * Throughtput(): to calculate
		 *         Throughput: to calculate Once Transmission Time
		 *         Onceframe is 1500;
		 * Oncetime equation is:
		 *         DIFSt+Preamblet+RTSt+SIFSt+Preamblet+CTSt+SIFSt+Preamble   t+DATAt+SIFSt+Preamblet+ACKt
		 * Throughtput Equation is: 
		 * 		   Once_frame/Once_time
		 * TotalTime Equation is:
		 * 		  OnceTime*TransmissionTimes
